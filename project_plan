1.Get most of the images from old zoo repo. Animals pictures and textures images.
2. download assignment textfile from omniway and make data.js file.

folder structure:

app.jsx
    -Routes
        <R>-Layout
            <R>Home
            <R>main-group route (map)
                <R>group-animal route (map by category/group)
        </R>   


Layout.jsx will hold:
    Header
    Outlet
    Footer


Components--
Header: 
   design > Icon Nav/mobile Park-name

    Icon, just find something 'Australia'
    
    Navigation:
        Navigation will import data about the groups and (map) a
        new component. This component consist of <NavLink> so it can point to chosen route.
    
    Park-name is going to be a CSS design.

  MainInformationBox -- right, flex: 1

MainInformationBox
            -will check if we have a 'current animal' in state.
             this state will render a components with different info.
            -if we do, render animal introduction. (this one also have a 'preview' prop coming directly from router. Different type information renders.)
            -if not -> show welcome message.
    
PopUp
        I want this to be a 50-70% background opacity over whole site.
        If i have this one inside this page, it can clean up alot byitself. In the middle i want to try something like a "center" view which can be quite small so i force a scrollbar. Want to practice more with scrollbars. Also i want it to contain information within a grid. Close button and a header containing animal name.

        will take a state-prop from dynamicpage for activating popup.

        design idea: ----name----X
                     ----pic--info
                    descirption---
    
 Sidebar
        Container wrapping with flex(column).
        Will be depended on catergory aninamls for (map).
        It will generate a button component. Re-suseable button
        component for mobile aswell.

        Sidebatton:
        need animal state and a path prop. 
        Going to use a button if Home and NavLink if specific category animal for routing. Want to test to use both. 

CallbackButton
    button that just takes a callback and a custom style class.
    Resuable when needed.

Footer
    -Name/year > center.

MobileSidebar
    Take icons from a npm-package, have it on top left and reuse sidebutton-component. CSS fixes for mobile. Hidden if above @media query reqs.  onClick will have a togglestate

MobileNav
    Icons from a npm-package, use in header right corner. Hidden if above @media query reqs. onClick will have a togglestate
       

Pages will have a DynamicPage i'll reuse. DynamicPage.jsx
    state: currentAnimal, reviewAnimal, category/group of the current selection.
    UseEffect for group/category

    flex: 1
    PopUp -- hidden
    Sidebar -- left, flex: 0 0 10-20% (test)
   

POST RESULT: 

    Totally missed that PopUp will cover everything except Header. I had to move popup into layout and wrap it together with Outlet and Footer.

    Since i had to move PopUp away from DynamicPage into Layout, i had to put some states up one level and make alot of props into router. This made it very messy. It is what it is.

    There was in some usecases where i wanted to use reducers and dispatchers instead of state, but kept the code around the assignment rules.

    I didnt go with dynamic :ids routing.

    I added some additional components just to clean up some html puzzle.
